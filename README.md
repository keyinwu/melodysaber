# Melody Saber

Melody Saber is an immersive music game inspired by the popular rhythm game Beat Saber [1]. Different from Beat Saber which plays out the entire music piece regardless of the playerâ€™s performance, our Melody Saber allows the user to generate a customized game map of pop songs and play different melody clips depending on how they hit the game block. The user can generate accompaniments based on deep learning models Chorderator [2] and Accomontage [3], choose a track to chop into blocks, and generate the music game map in a Virtual Reality (VR) environment through Unity. By enabling players to generate their unique melody track, Melody Saber creates an innovative music game experience combined with music game map generator.
